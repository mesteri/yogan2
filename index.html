                            We are a small vegan yoghurt manufacture in Plymouth.
                             Our mission is to serve our customers with the best vegan products,
                             which are premium quality & eco-friendly for optimum health, 
                             with careful selection of the best natural ingredients.
                             For this reason, our products are exclusively plant-based,
                             like coconut, almond, and soy milk. We offer a wide variety of flavours to suit all tastes (we invite you to look at our range of yoghurts, yoghurt shakes, and cakes).
                             <br></br>
                             Our packaging is eco-friendly and 100% biodegradable. 
                             We use bioplastics which are practically plastics made from plants.
                             The starch within most plants can be used to form plastic polymers. 
                             Our bioplastic bags, pots, and boxes are made from corn, so you wonâ€™t 
                             leave any carbon footprint behind with them when you buy from us.

                            We support a healthy, and eco-friendly lifestyle and help people with food intolerance
                             and allergies with safer and healthier choices. We live the vegan life every day,
                             all year round, and enjoy its health benefits in our lives.
                             We believe in pure plant-based nutrition therefore none of our products have any animal ingredient,
                             neither milk nor eggs. Veganism is more than a diet though, 
                             it is also about being kind to animals and against all forms of exploitation of them.
